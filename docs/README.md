## Abstract

This research addresses critical domain generalization challenges in medical imaging by introducing **BiomedXPro**, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with interpretable prompt optimization. Using BiomedCLIP as the baseline model, we propose an evolutionary algorithm-based automatic prompting method that significantly improves both interpretability and out-of-domain generalization through iterative feedback mechanisms with Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Our approach specifically targets disease classification tasks from histopathological images, addressing the fundamental challenge of maintaining model performance when deploying AI systems across different medical institutions with varying equipment, protocols, and patient demographics. The framework generates human-readable diagnostic prompts that capture clinically relevant visual discriminative features, ensuring both robust performance and explainable decision-making processes essential for clinical adoption.

Key achievements include achieving 93.06% accuracy on the CAMELYON17 dataset while maintaining full interpretability, demonstrating superior out-of-domain generalization across multiple hospital centers, and providing quantifiable contributions of each diagnostic observation to final predictions.

## Introduction and Background

### Medical Image Analysis Challenges

Medical image analysis plays a crucial role in modern healthcare, encompassing disease diagnosis, treatment guidance, image segmentation, and various other clinical applications. While significant advances have been made in medical AI systems, several critical challenges persist when deploying these systems in real-world clinical scenarios:

#### Domain Shift Problem

Domain shift represents one of the most significant barriers to successful deployment of AI systems in medical imaging. This phenomenon occurs when there are discrepancies between the training distribution (source domain) and the unseen distribution (target domain) where the model is deployed. In medical imaging contexts, domain shift manifests through:

- **Cross-Site Variability**: Different hospitals use varying equipment manufacturers, imaging protocols, and acquisition parameters
- **Equipment Differences**: Variations in scanner specifications, software versions, and calibration procedures
- **Institutional Protocols**: Different preprocessing techniques, image enhancement methods, and quality control standards
- **Patient Demographics**: Variations in population characteristics, disease prevalence, and comorbidities across different geographic regions

The consequence of domain shift is significant performance degradation when models trained on data from one institution are deployed in new clinical settings, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy and patient safety.

#### Explainability Requirements

Modern healthcare demands AI systems that not only perform accurately but also provide transparent, interpretable decision-making processes. Medical professionals require:

- **Clinical Reasoning**: Understanding why a particular diagnosis was made
- **Confidence Assessment**: Quantifiable measures of diagnostic certainty
- **Feature Attribution**: Identification of specific visual features that contributed to the decision
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting standards for medical device approval and clinical validation

### Vision Language Models in Medical Imaging

Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and its biomedical variant BiomedCLIP, have emerged as promising solutions for addressing both domain generalization and explainability challenges:

#### Key Advantages of VLMs:

1. **Zero-Shot Classification Capabilities**: Models can classify images without task-specific training by leveraging natural language descriptions
2. **Inherent Interpretability**: Classifications are based on natural language prompts that humans can understand and validate
3. **Robustness to Distribution Shifts**: Pre-training on diverse datasets provides inherent resilience to domain variations
4. **Multimodal Understanding**: Joint representation learning enables sophisticated reasoning about visual-textual relationships

#### BiomedCLIP Architecture

BiomedCLIP represents the state-of-the-art in biomedical vision-language models, specifically designed for medical imaging applications. The model architecture consists of:

- **Vision Encoder**: Processes medical images and extracts visual features
- **Text Encoder**: Processes natural language descriptions and creates textual representations
- **Shared Embedding Space**: Aligns visual and textual representations for similarity-based classification
- **Contrastive Learning**: Optimizes the model to maximize similarity between matching image-text pairs while minimizing similarity between non-matching pairs

---

## Problem Statement

Despite the promising capabilities of biomedical CLIP models, current approaches face a critical limitation that hinders their clinical adoption:

**Core Challenge**: Biomedical CLIP models demonstrate inherent robustness to distribution shifts, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through context optimization techniques. However, existing context optimization methods rely on uninterpretable "soft" prompts - learned vector representations that lack human readability.

**Clinical Implications**: This lack of interpretability presents a fundamental barrier for clinical adoption, where both out-of-domain generalization AND explainability are paramount requirements for reliable AI-driven diagnostics. Medical professionals cannot trust or validate diagnostic decisions based on abstract vector representations that provide no clinical reasoning.

**Specific Limitations of Current Approaches**:

1. **Soft Vector Learning**: Context optimization methods like CoOp generate numerical vectors (e.g., [1.3, 2.3, 4.2, ...]) that cannot be interpreted by medical professionals
2. **Single Static Outputs**: Many existing methods rely on single LLM outputs without iterative refinement
3. **Limited Clinical Validation**: Generated prompts often lack verification against established medical knowledge
4. **Insufficient Diversity**: Single optimal prompt approaches fail to capture the complexity of medical diagnostic reasoning

### Vision-Language Models in Biomedical Applications

The development of vision-language models has revolutionized biomedical image analysis, with several key contributions shaping the field:

#### Foundation Models

**CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)**: Introduced the concept of learning joint representations of images and text through contrastive learning. While effective for natural images, CLIP's performance on specialized biomedical images remained limited due to domain-specific terminology and visual characteristics.

**BiomedCLIP**: Specifically designed for biomedical applications, this model was trained on biomedical image-text pairs, significantly improving performance on medical imaging tasks while maintaining the interpretability advantages of the original CLIP architecture.

#### Prompt Learning Approaches

**BiomedCoOp**: Extended the Context Optimization (CoOp) approach to biomedical domains, learning continuous prompt vectors that optimize classification performance. However, these learned vectors lack interpretability, making clinical validation challenging.

**XCoOp**: Introduced cross-modal prompt learning, attempting to bridge vision and language modalities more effectively. Despite improved performance, the fundamental interpretability limitation persisted.

#### Limitations of Existing Approaches

1. **Interpretability Gap**: Most existing methods focus solely on performance optimization, neglecting the critical need for explainable diagnostic reasoning
2. **Single Prompt Limitation**: Many approaches optimize for a single "best" prompt, failing to capture the diversity of diagnostic observations
3. **Static Generation**: Limited use of iterative refinement processes that could improve prompt quality over time
4. **Clinical Validation Deficit**: Insufficient integration of medical domain expertise in prompt generation and validation

### Gap in Current Research

Our comprehensive literature review revealed a significant gap: no existing method successfully combines high performance with interpretable prompt generation for biomedical vision-language models. This gap represents a critical barrier to clinical adoption and motivated our development of BiomedXPro.

## Methodology

Our methodology introduces BiomedXPro, a novel framework that addresses the interpretability-performance trade-off through evolutionary prompt optimization. The approach consists of several integrated components:

### 1. Preprocessing Pipeline

#### Data Quality Assurance
- **File Integrity Checks**: Verification of image file completeness and format consistency
- **Metadata Validation**: Ensuring all required clinical annotations are present and properly formatted
- **Quality Control**: Identification and handling of corrupted or low-quality images

#### Image Standardization
- **Normalization**: Standardizing pixel values across different acquisition protocols and equipment
- **Resizing**: Uniform resizing to 224×224 pixels to match BiomedCLIP input requirements
- **Color Space Consistency**: Ensuring consistent color representation across different imaging sources

#### Dataset Preparation
- **Label Unification**: Standardizing diagnostic labels across different institutional coding systems
- **Demographic Balancing**: Ensuring representative distribution of patient demographics and disease subtypes
- **Domain-Aware Splitting**: Creating training/validation/test splits that respect domain boundaries for proper out-of-domain evaluation

### 2. Evolutionary Prompt Optimization Framework

#### Theoretical Foundation
Our approach leverages Large Language Models as implicit optimizers, drawing inspiration from evolutionary algorithms and gradient-free optimization techniques. The key insight is that LLMs can serve multiple roles:

- **Prompt Engineers**: Generating diverse, clinically relevant diagnostic descriptions
- **Knowledge Extractors**: Leveraging vast medical knowledge to create meaningful prompts
- **Optimizers**: Using performance feedback to iteratively improve prompt quality

#### LLM Integration Strategy
We utilize Gemma3 27B as our primary LLM, selected for its strong performance in medical domain tasks and cost-effectiveness for iterative optimization processes.

### 3. Multi-Stage Optimization Process

#### Stage 1: Initial Prompt Population Generation

**Meta-Prompt Design (Q₀)**:
```
Give 50 textual description pairs of visual discriminative features to identify whether the central region of a histopathological image patch contains tumor tissue or not. The patch is extracted from an H&E‑stained whole‑slide image of a lymph node section.
```

This initial meta-prompt is carefully crafted to:
- Specify the exact clinical context (histopathological lymph node analysis)
- Request discriminative feature pairs (positive and negative classes)
- Generate sufficient diversity (50 initial prompts) for robust optimization

#### Stage 2: Fitness Evaluation and Selection

**Fitness Score Calculation**:
The fitness function evaluates each prompt pair based on classification performance:
```
f(p) = Performance_Metric(BiomedCLIP_with_prompt_p, training_data)
```

We experimented with multiple fitness metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification correctness
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Discrimination capability across thresholds
- **Inverted Cross-Entropy Loss**: Focusing on confident correct predictions
- **F1 Score**: Balanced consideration of precision and recall

**Roulette Wheel Selection**:
This probabilistic selection mechanism ensures:
- **Exploitation**: Higher-performing prompts have greater selection probability
- **Exploration**: Lower-performing prompts retain selection chance for diversity
- **Balance**: Prevents premature convergence to local optima

#### Stage 3: Iterative Prompt Generation

**Optimizer Meta-Prompt (Qᵢ)**:
```
The task is to generate textual descriptions pairs of visual discriminative features to identify whether the central region of an histopathological image patch contains tumor tissue or not.

Here are the best performing pairs in descending order:
1. (..., ...) Score: 90
2. (..., ...) Score: 84
...

Write 10 new prompt pairs that are different from the old ones and has a score as high as possible.
```

This iterative process enables:
- **Guided Evolution**: Using performance feedback to direct prompt generation
- **Diversity Maintenance**: Explicit instruction to generate different prompts
- **Quality Improvement**: Targeting higher performance scores

#### Stage 4: Diversity Maintenance Through Crowding

**Crowding Meta-Prompt (Qc)**:
The crowding mechanism prevents convergence to semantically identical prompts with different linguistic expressions:

```
Group the prompt pairs that have exactly the same medical observation but differ only in language variations. Provide the output as grouped indices.
```

This process:
- **Identifies Redundancy**: Groups semantically equivalent prompts
- **Maintains Diversity**: Eliminates linguistic variations while preserving conceptual diversity
- **Improves Efficiency**: Reduces computational overhead from redundant evaluations

### 4. Final Prompt Selection and Ensemble

#### Elbow Analysis for Optimal Prompt Count
Rather than using a fixed number of final prompts, we employ elbow analysis on the fitness score distribution to automatically determine the optimal number of prompts that maximize diversity while maintaining high performance.

#### Weighted Ensemble Voting
**Final Classification Process**:
1. **Individual Prompt Evaluation**: Each selected prompt pair provides a binary vote (tumor/normal)
2. **Weight Calculation**: Fitness scores are normalized to create prompt-specific weights
3. **Weighted Aggregation**: Final decision combines all votes using calculated weights
4. **Threshold Application**: Scores > 0.5 indicate tumor presence

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
Final_Score = Σᵢ (Normalized_Fitness_Score_i × Vote_i)
Prediction = Final_Score > 0.5 ? "Tumor" : "Normal"
```
