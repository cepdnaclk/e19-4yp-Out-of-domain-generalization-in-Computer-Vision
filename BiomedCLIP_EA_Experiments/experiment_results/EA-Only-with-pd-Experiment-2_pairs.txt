The mantle zone is well-defined, and there is minimal inflammatory infiltrate or evidence of necrosis/apoptosis.', 'H&E-stained lymph node tissue demonstrates markedly disrupted architecture with proliferation of thick-walled sinusoidal capillaries. Germinal centers are large, atypical, and lack clear polarization, exhibiting a diffuse growth pattern. Cells show significant nuclear pleomorphism, irregular shapes, coarse chromatin, frequent atypical mitotic figures, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Extensive necrosis, apoptotic bodies, and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate are present.'), Score: 0.7561
('Lymphocytes demonstrate a uniform, small cell morphology with densely stained nuclei and minimal cytoplasm.  The architecture is preserved with clearly defined lymphoid follicles containing prominent germinal centers.  There is a sparse, normal inflammatory infiltrate composed primarily of small lymphocytes. No atypical cells or Reed-Sternberg variants are observed.', 'Lymphocytes exhibit marked pleomorphism with large, irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm. The follicular architecture is disrupted or absent, replaced by diffuse sheets of atypical cells. A robust inflammatory infiltrate is present, including numerous eosinophils and plasma cells. Atypical lymphoid cells, including potential Reed-Sternberg cells or their variants, are identified.'), Score: 0.7549
('Lymph node shows preserved architecture with regular sinusoidal pattern. Small lymphocytes exhibit round, densely condensed nuclei and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. No atypical mitotic figures are present.', 'Lymph node architecture is disrupted with congested sinuses and loss of follicular structure. Cells display pleomorphic nuclei with irregular contours, prominent nucleoli, and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, indicative of malignancy. Atypical mitotic figures are frequently observed.'), Score: 0.7543

('Lymphocytes are evenly distributed with minimal variation in size.', 'Lymphocytes are clustered and exhibit significant pleomorphism.'), Score: 0.7528
('Lymph node architecture is preserved with regular sinuses. Stroma is delicate and collagenous. Cells are small lymphocytes with round, condensed nuclei and scant cytoplasm. No atypical mitotic figures are seen.', 'Lymph node architecture is disrupted with congested sinuses and increased cellularity. Stroma is dense and desmoplastic. Cells exhibit atypical nuclei with irregular shapes, prominent nucleoli, and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios. Atypical mitotic figures are frequently observed.'), Score: 0.7520
('Follicular center with organized germinal centers and low cellularity.', 'Follicular center with irregular germinal centers, high cellularity, and frequent mitotic figures.'), Score: 0.7518
('Lymphocytes exhibit regular morphology with small, hyperchromatic nuclei and infrequent mitotic activity. Follicular architecture is intact with distinct germinal centers.  There is minimal inflammatory infiltrate and no evidence of Reed-Sternberg cells.', 'Lymphocytes display atypical morphology with large, vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and frequent mitotic figures. Follicular architecture is effaced, with poorly defined or absent germinal centers.  A significant inflammatory infiltrate is present, and Reed-Sternberg cells or Hodgkin-like cells are identified.'), Score: 0.7511
