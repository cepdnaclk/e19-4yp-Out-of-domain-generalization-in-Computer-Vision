      "Okay, let's analyze the situation. The last 5 iterations showed no improvement, meaning the current prompts are likely plateauing in effectiveness. We need to shake things up. Simply paraphrasing or adding borderline cases hasn't worked. The goal is to generate *discriminative* features. This suggests we need to focus on prompts that explicitly ask for features that *differentiate* tumor from non-tumor tissue, and potentially focus on features that are often *missed* or subtle.\n",

      "2. **Cellular Atypia Details:** Beyond just \"atypical cells,\" we need to probe for *specific* atypical features (size, shape, nuclear features, etc.).\n",
      "3. **Stroma Changes:** Tumor presence often alters the surrounding stroma. Prompts should ask about stromal density, collagen content, and inflammatory cell infiltration.\n",
      "4. **Mitotic Activity:** Increased mitotic activity is a hallmark of tumor tissue.\n",
      "5. **Negative Space/Patterning:** The arrangement of cells and the spaces between them can be informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, I'm going to instruct the model to generate prompts that specifically target these areas, and to *contrast* tumor features with normal lymph node features. I'll also ask for prompts that focus on features that are commonly confused.\n",
