('Cells with large, singular cytoplasmic vacuoles occupying a significant portion of the cell are not typical of eosinophils.', 'Eosinophils may contain small vacuoles, but their cytoplasm is primarily filled with granules, not large singular vacuoles.'), Score: 0.5013
('Cells with a cytoplasm containing numerous small, indistinct granules are more likely to be neutrophils or lymphocytes.', 'Eosinophil granules are large, easily visible, and consistently stain a bright pink-red color.'), Score: 0.5011
('Cells with fine, evenly distributed cytoplasmic granules are more likely to be neutrophils.', 'Eosinophil granules are large, coarse, and often irregularly shaped, not fine and evenly distributed.'), Score: 0.5008
('Cells with granules that stain a dark blue or purple color are indicative of basophils or mast cells, not eosinophils.', 'Eosinophil granules specifically stain a bright pink-red color due to their eosin content.'), Score: 0.5007
('Eosinophils with a cytoplasm containing vacuoles that displace the granules are atypical and may indicate cellular degeneration.', 'Eosinophils exhibit a cytoplasm densely packed with eosinophilic granules, with minimal presence of large, disruptive vacuoles.'), Score: 0.5007
('Cells with a round or spherical shape are more likely to be lymphocytes, not eosinophils.', 'Eosinophils typically have an irregular, slightly elongated shape, rather than a perfectly round one.'), Score: 0.5007
