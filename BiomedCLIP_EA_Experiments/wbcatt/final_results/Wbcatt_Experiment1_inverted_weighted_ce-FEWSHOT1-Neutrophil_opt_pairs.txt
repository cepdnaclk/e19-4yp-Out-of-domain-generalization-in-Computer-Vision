('Lymphocytes have a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and a dense, homogenous chromatin pattern.', 'Neutrophils have a low nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and a dispersed chromatin pattern within each nuclear lobe.'), Score: 0.0101
('Eosinophils have granules that are uniform in size and shape.', 'Neutrophils have granules that are variable in size and shape.'), Score: 0.0101
('A dark blue cytoplasm with large granules is characteristic of basophils.', 'Neutrophils have a pale blue cytoplasm with numerous, fine granules.'), Score: 0.0101
('Eosinophils are typically larger than neutrophils.', 'Neutrophils are generally medium-sized cells, smaller than eosinophils and basophils.'), Score: 0.0101
