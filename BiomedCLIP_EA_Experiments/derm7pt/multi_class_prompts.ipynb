      "    *   **Absent:** Diffuse pigmentation, homogenous skin, lack of lines/dots.\n",
      "    *   **Typical:** Reticular (net-like), regular spacing, consistent pigmentation, fine lines.\n",
      "    *   **Atypical:**  Globular, branching streaks, radial streaming, asymmetry, abrupt changes, regression structures, blotches, distorted patterns, combination of patterns.\n",
