      "    *   **Atypical:** Highlight irregularity, asymmetry, branching, clumping, distortion, and changes in pigmentation.\n",
      "3.  **Incorporate texture and depth:**  Terms like \"raised,\" \"flat,\" \"smooth,\" \"rough,\" \"layered,\" and \"diffuse\" can add valuable information.\n",
      "4.  **Consider color variations:**  Beyond just \"brown,\" use terms like \"greyish,\" \"tan,\" \"dark brown,\" \"light brown,\" \"reddish,\" \"blueish-grey\" to describe pigment variations.\n",
      "5.  **Avoid repetition:** Ensure the new prompts are distinct from the existing ones.\n",
