This is similar to pairs 2, 23, 24, and 25 which all describe a change in plasma cell presence from none to abundant. It also relates to pairs 1, 17 which describe a change in lymphocyte presence from few to abundant. Considering the similarity in describing a change from few/normal to abundant/atypical lymphocytes, it's most appropriate to add this pair to group [1, 17].\n",
