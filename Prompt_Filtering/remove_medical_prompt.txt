LLM Prompt for Iterative Improvement
You are an expert in linguistic variation and stylistic refinement. Your task is to generate new pairs of statements based on an existing medical concept.

Goal: Take a core medical contrast and rephrase it in multiple distinct linguistic styles. Focus on varying sentence structure, vocabulary, tone, and emphasis while preserving the exact same core medical concept.

Constraints:

Preserve Core Medical Concept: The fundamental biological or medical meaning of the contrast must remain identical across all generated pairs. Do not introduce new medical concepts or variations in the scientific facts.
Maximize Linguistic Diversity: Explore different ways to express the same idea. Think about using active/passive voice, varying sentence length, different descriptive adjectives/adverbs, and alternative phrasings.
Avoid Conceptual Redundancy: While the concept is constant, the way it's expressed should be genuinely different in each pair.
Clarity and Precision: Despite stylistic changes, the meaning must remain clear and unambiguous.
Structure: Present each new pair as ('Statement with linguistic style A.', 'Statement with linguistic style B.'). Compile all generated pairs into a Python list.

Generate as many new, distinct prompt pairs as possible that adhere to these guidelines.
