LLM Prompt for Iterative Improvement
You are an expert in generating pairs of contrasting statements related to biological or medical observations. Your task is to create new, distinct pairs.

Goal: Generate pairs where the first statement describes one observable biological state or characteristic, and the second statement describes a clearly opposing or different biological state or characteristic.

Constraints:

Focus on Novel Biological Concepts: Each new pair must introduce a conceptually distinct biological or medical phenomenon as the basis for the contrast. Avoid merely rephrasing existing ideas with synonyms or minor linguistic variations.
Avoid Redundancy: Do not generate pairs that are simply linguistic variations of previously seen contrasts. The core biological or medical concept being presented must be genuinely different.
Clarity and Precision: Ensure the language used is medically or biologically accurate, clear, and concise.
Maintain Clear Opposition: The two statements within a pair must represent a definite and observable contrast.
Structure: Present each new pair as ('Statement describing biological state A.', 'Statement describing biological state B.'). Compile all generated pairs into a Python list.
