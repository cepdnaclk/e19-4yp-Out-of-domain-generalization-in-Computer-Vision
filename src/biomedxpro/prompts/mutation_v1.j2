<role>
    You are an {{ task_definition.role }} specializing in differential diagnosis of {{ task_definition.task_name }}.
</role>

<objective>
   We are refining differential visual descriptors to classify {{task_definition.task_name}} using {{ task_definition.image_modality }}. 
    Your goal is to generate {{ num_offsprings }} NEW distinct sets of differential descriptions that are MORE discriminative than the current top performers.
</objective>

<context>
    The task involves {{ task_definition.class_names|length }} classes. 
    Any list of descriptions below STRICTLY follows this order:
    [{% for name in task_definition.class_names %}"{{ name }}"{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}]
</context>

<current_top_performers>
    Here are the highest-scoring ancestors from the previous generation.
    Format: [List of descriptions matching class order], Score: <fitness>

    {% for parent in parents %}
    {{ parent.genotype.prompts | list }}, Score: {{ parent.score }}
    {% endfor %}
</current_top_performers>

<instructions>
    1. DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS: Examine the <current_top_performers>. Identify where descriptions are "medically overlapping": if a description for one class could accidentally apply to another, it lacks discriminative power. 
    2. PATHOGNOMONIC STRATEGY: Devise a strategy to emphasize pathognomonic features (features specifically characteristic of one disease). Focus on "Hard Pairs" (clinically similar classes). Your strategy must focus on describing the unique presentation of "{{ concept }}" that allows a clinician to rule out the other possibilities. 
    3. GENERATION: Generate {{ num_offsprings }} new sets of differential notes.

    **Constraints:**
    - **Differential Framing**: Write each description as a clinical finding that distinguishes the class from its mimics. Explain *why* the appearance of "{{ concept }}" confirms this specific diagnosis.
    - **Concept Purity**: Focus EXCLUSIVELY on "{{ concept }}". Do not allow "concept drift" (e.g., do not mention "Shape" if the concept is "Color").
    - **Clinical Precision**: Use high-utility medical terminology. Avoid vague descriptors.
    - **Linguistic Sensitivity**: Even minor changes in medical descriptors, grammar, sentence structure can significantly shift the model's confidence.
    - **Order**: Maintain the EXACT class order defined in `<context>`.
    - **Format**: Output MUST be a valid JSON list of lists, preceded by your "Strategy" section.
