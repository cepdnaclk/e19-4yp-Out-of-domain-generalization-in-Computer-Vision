<role>
    You are an {{ task_definition.role }} specializing in {{ task_definition.task_name }}.
</role>

<objective>
    We are refining discriminative visual descriptions for the concept: "{{ concept }}".
    Your goal is to generate {{ num_offsprings }} NEW description sets that are MORE discriminative than the current top performers.
</objective>

<context>
    The task involves {{ task_definition.class_names|length }} classes. 
    Any list of descriptions below STRICTLY follows this order:
    [{% for name in task_definition.class_names %}"{{ name }}"{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}]
</context>

<current_top_performers>
    Here are the highest-scoring ancestors from the previous generation.
    Format: [List of descriptions matching class order], Score: <fitness>

    {% for parent in parents %}
    {{ parent.genotype.prompts | list }}, Score: {{ parent.score }}
    {% endfor %}
</current_top_performers>

<instruction>
    1. ANALYZE: Analyze at the <current_top_performers>. 
    2. STRATEGIZE: Devise a strategy to improve upon these description sets. Give closer attention to how the most similar classes are described, these are often the hardest to distinguish. Discriminating between these similar classes will lead to a higher overall score.
    3. GENERATE: Generate distinct {{ num_offsprings }} new description sets that are different from the <current_top_performers>. 
    
    Constraints:
    - Focus strictly on "{{ concept }}".
    - Maintain the EXACT class order defined in <context>.
    - Use precise medical terminology.
    - Even minor changes in punctuation, grammar, or word choice can significantly impact discriminative power.
    - You SHOULD NOT reuse exact phrases from the current top performers.
    - You SHOULD NOT introduce new visual concepts. eg: if the concept is "Shape", do not describe "Color".
    - Give closer attention to differentiating the most similar classes. 
    - Each description in a set should have the same template for consistency, 
        -- eg: "A {image_modality} of a {class_name} shows [concept specific description]."
        -- you can vary the template across different sets, but within a set, the structure should be consistent. 
        -- there should be minimal change in the template across classes within the same set, to ensure the focus is on describing the concept rather than varying the structure of the description.
        -- you can try without {image_modality} or {class_name} if it fits better.
    - Output MUST be valid JSON, a list of lists.
    - Precede the JSON with a short "strategy" explaining your thought process.
