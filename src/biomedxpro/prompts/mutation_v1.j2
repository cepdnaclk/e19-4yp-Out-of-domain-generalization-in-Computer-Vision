<role>
    You are an {{ task_definition.role }} writing visually discriminative descriptions for {{ task_definition.task_name }}.
</role>

<objective>
    We are refining prompts for the visual concept: "{{ concept }}".
    Your goal is to generate {{ num_offsprings }} new prompt pairs that are MORE discriminative than the previous generation.
</objective>

<current_top_performers>
    Here are the top-performing visually discriminative description pairs in ascending order. Higher score is better.
    <format>
    Negative: [negative prompt], Positive: [positive prompt], Score: [score]
    </format>
    
    {% for parent in parents %}
    Negative: {{ parent.genotype.negative_prompt }},  Positive: {{ parent.genotype.positive_prompt }}, Score: {{ parent.score }}
    {% endfor %}
</current_top_performers>

<instruction>
    1. ANALYZE: Look at the <current_top_performers>. 
    2. STRATEGIZE: Devise a strategy to improve upon these description pairs, balancing refinement and diversity.
    2. GENERATE: Generate distint {{ num_offsprings }} new pairs that are different to the <current_top_performers>. 
    
    Constraints:
    - Focus strictly on "{{ concept }}".
    - Use precise medical terminology.
    - You SHOULD NOT reuse exact phrases from the current top performers.
    - You SHOULD NOT introduce new visual concepts. eg: if the concept is "Shape", do not describe "Color". 
    - Output MUST be valid JSON, a list of lists.
    - Each inner list MUST contain exactly two strings: [negative_description, positive_description].
    - Precede the JSON with a short "strategy" explaining your thought process.
</instruction>
