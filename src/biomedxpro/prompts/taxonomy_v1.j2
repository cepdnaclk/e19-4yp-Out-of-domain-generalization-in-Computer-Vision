<role>
You are a senior {{ task_defition.role }} with extensive expertise in {{ task_defition.image_modality }}.
You are architecting a decision support system for {{ task_defition.task_name }}.
</role>

<objective>
Your goal is to organize the input list of diagnostic classes into a HIERARCHICAL BINARY DECISION TREE.

Why?
Generalist classifiers fail to capture subtle features. By breaking the problem into a binary tree, we can train specialized "Expert Models" at each node.

Strategy:
1. Prioritize VISUAL SEPARABILITY. Group classes that look similar together, so they can be distinguished deeper in the tree.
2. The Root Node should represent the most fundamental visual or clinical split (e.g., Normal vs. Abnormal, Fluid vs. Solid).
3. Child nodes should handle increasingly specific distinctions.
</objective>

<input_data>
Task Name: {{ task_defition.task_name }}
Modality: {{ task_defition.image_modality }}
Classes to Organize: {{ task_defition.class_names | tojson }}
</input_data>

<constraints>
1. Output MUST be valid JSON.
2. The structure MUST be a Binary Tree (each node has 0 or 2 children).
3. Every node object must have:
   - "node_id": A unique snake_case string ID (e.g., "root", "node_cystic_lesions").
   - "group_name": A descriptive medical label for the decision context (e.g., "Focal Renal Lesions").
   - "left_classes": List of class names mapping to the Left Branch.
   - "right_classes": List of class names mapping to the Right Branch.
   - "children": An object containing "left" and "right" sub-nodes.
4. Leaf Nodes: If a branch contains only specific classes and needs no further split, "children" for that side must be null.
5. BIJECTIVE MAPPING: The Union of "left_classes" and "right_classes" at any node MUST exactly equal the list of classes assigned to that branch.
6. DO NOT invent new classes. DO NOT rename input classes. Use the strings exactly as provided.
</constraints>

<examples>
Here is an example of how you should structure the JSON for a Kidney Dataset (Normal, Cyst, Stone, Tumor):

{
  "node_id": "ROOT_RENAL",
  "group_name": "Renal Parenchymal Analysis",
  "left_classes": ["Normal Kidney"],
  "right_classes": ["Kidney Cyst", "Kidney Stone", "Kidney Tumor"],
  "children": {
    "left": null,
    "right": {
      "node_id": "FOCAL_PATHOLOGY",
      "group_name": "Focal Renal Lesions",
      "left_classes": ["Kidney Cyst"],
      "right_classes": ["Kidney Stone", "Kidney Tumor"],
      "children": {
        "left": null,
        "right": {
          "node_id": "SOLID_MASSES",
          "group_name": "Solid & Calcified Findings",
          "left_classes": ["Kidney Stone"],
          "right_classes": ["Kidney Tumor"],
          "children": { "left": null, "right": null }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
