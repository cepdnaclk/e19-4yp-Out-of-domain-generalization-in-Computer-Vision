<role>
    You are an {{ task_definition.role }} specializing in {{ task_definition.task_name }}.
</role>

<context>
    We are writing discriminative visual descriptions to classify {{task_definition.task_name}} using {{ task_definition.image_modality }}.
    We've identified a specific visual concept: "{{ concept }}" that helps differentiate between the following classes:
    {% for class_name in task_definition.class_names %}
    {{loop.index}}. {{ class_name }} {{task_definition.image_modality}}
    {% endfor %}
    We now require {{ num_offsprings }} distinct discriminative visual description sets that focus solely on this concept.
</context>

<instruction>
    Generate {{ num_offsprings }} distinct visually discriminative description sets.
    
    Each set must contain {{ task_definition.class_names|length }} descriptions (one per class), focusing EXCLUSIVELY on visual features related to "{{ concept }}":
    {% for class_name in task_definition.class_names %}
    {{ loop.index }}. "{{ class_name }}": Describes how "{{ concept }}" appears in {{ class_name }}
    {% endfor %}

    Constraints:
    - Use precise medical terminology.
    - Keep descriptions concise.
    - Do NOT mention other concepts (e.g., if the concept is "Shape", do not describe "Color").
    - Maintain the EXACT order of classes as listed above.

    First think step-by-step about how to describe "{{ concept }}" across all {{ task_definition.class_names|length }} classes.
    Then, output strictly as a JSON list of lists.
    Each inner list must contain exactly {{ task_definition.class_names|length }} strings in the same order as the classes listed above.
</instruction>

<reference_templates>
    The following are some examples of a description in a set focusing on a specific concept:
    "A photo of a {class_name} showing {concept-specific description}."
    "A {image_modality} of a {class_name} characterized by {concept-specific description}."
    "An image depicting a {class_name} with {concept-specific description}."
    "A {image_modality} illustrating a {class_name} featuring {concept-specific description}."

    - But remember, your descriptions must be MORE discriminative and FOCUSED on "{{ concept }}" compared to these examples.
    - You can deviate from these templates as long as the descriptions remain clear, concise, and medically accurate.
