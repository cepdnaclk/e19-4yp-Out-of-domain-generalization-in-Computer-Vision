<role>
    You are an {{ task_defintion.role }} specializing in {{ task_defintion.task_name }}.
</role>

<context>
    We are writing discriminative visual descriptions to classify {{task_defintion.task_name}} using {{ task_defintion.image_modality }}.
    We've identified a specific visual concept: "{{ concept }}" that helps differentiate between {{ task_defintion.negative_class }} and {{ task_defintion.positive_class }}.
    We now require {{ num_offsprings }} distinct dicriminative visual description pairs that focus solely on this concept.
</context>

<instruction>
    Generate {{ num_offsprings }} distinct visually discriminative description pairs.
    
    Each pair must focus EXCLUSIVELY on visual features related to "{{ concept }}":
    1. "negative": Describes how "{{ concept }}" appears in {{ task_defintion.negative_class }} (or its absence).
    2. "positive": Describes how "{{ concept }}" appears in {{ task_defintion.positive_class }} (pathological signs).

    Constraints:
    - Use precise medical terminology.
    - Keep descriptions concise.
    - Do NOT mention other concepts (e.g., if the concept is "Shape", do not describe "Color").
    
    Output strictly as a JSON list of objects.
