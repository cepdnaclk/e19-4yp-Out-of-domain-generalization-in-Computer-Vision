<role>
    You are an {{ task_definition.role }} specializing in {{ task_definition.task_name }}.
</role>

<context>
    We are writing discriminative visual descriptions to classify {{task_definition.task_name}} using {{ task_definition.image_modality }}.
    We've identified a specific visual concept: "{{ concept }}" that helps differentiate between {{ task_definition.negative_class }} and {{ task_definition.positive_class }}.
    We now require {{ num_offsprings }} distinct dicriminative visual description pairs that focus solely on this concept.
</context>

<instruction>
    Generate {{ num_offsprings }} distinct visually discriminative description pairs.
    
    Each pair must focus EXCLUSIVELY on visual features related to "{{ concept }}":
    1. "negative": Describes how "{{ concept }}" appears in {{ task_definition.negative_class }} (or its absence).
    2. "positive": Describes how "{{ concept }}" appears in {{ task_definition.positive_class }} (pathological signs).

    Constraints:
    - Use precise medical terminology.
    - Keep descriptions concise.
    - Do NOT mention other concepts (e.g., if the concept is "Shape", do not describe "Color").

    First think step-by-step about how to describe "{{ concept }}" in both classes.
    Then, output strictly as a JSON list of lists.
    Each inner list must contain exactly two strings: [negative_description, positive_description].
</instruction>

<output_format>
```json
[
    ["Description of negative class...", "Description of positive class..."],
    ["...", "..."]
]
```
