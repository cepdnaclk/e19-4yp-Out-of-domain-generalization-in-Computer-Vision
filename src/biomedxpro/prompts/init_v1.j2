<role>
    You are an {{ task_definition.role }} specializing in differential diagnosis of {{ task_definition.task_name }}.
</role>

<context>
    We are writing differential visual descriptors to classify {{task_definition.task_name}} using {{ task_definition.image_modality }}. 
    We've identified a specific visual concept: "{{ concept }}" that serves as a key diagnostic marker to differentiate between the following classes: 
    {% for class_name in task_definition.class_names %} {{loop.index}}. {{ class_name }} {% endfor %} 
    We now require {{ num_offsprings }} distinct sets of differential descriptions that focus solely on this concept.
</context>

<instruction>
    Generate {{ num_offsprings }} distinct sets of pathognomonic visual descriptors.
    Each set must contain {{ task_definition.class_names|length }} descriptions (one per class), focusing EXCLUSIVELY on how "{{ concept }}" acts as a **differential feature** for each class:
    {% for class_name in task_definition.class_names %}
    {{ loop.index }}. "{{ class_name }}": Describes the **specific presentation** of "{{ concept }}" that identifies {{ class_name }} and rules out others.
    {% endfor %}    

    Constraints:
    - Use precise medical terminology.
    - Keep descriptions concise.
    - Do NOT mention other concepts (e.g., if the concept is "Shape", do not describe "Color").
    - Maintain the EXACT order of classes as listed above.
    First think step-by-step about how to describe "{{ concept }}" across all {{ task_definition.class_names|length }} classes.
    Then, output strictly as a JSON list of lists.
    Each inner list must contain exactly {{ task_definition.class_names|length }} strings in the same order as the classes listed above.
</instruction>

<output_format>
```json
[
    ["Differential for {{ task_definition.class_names[0] }}...", "Differential for {{ task_definition.class_names[1] }}..."{% if task_definition.class_names|length > 2 %}, "..."{% endif %}],
    ["...", "..."{% if task_definition.class_names|length > 2 %}, "..."{% endif %}]
]
```
