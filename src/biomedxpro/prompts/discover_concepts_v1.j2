<task_description>
    The goal is to identify distinct, high-level visual attributes that experts look for when distinguishing between:
    1. {{ task_definition.negative_class }} 
    2. {{ task_definition.positive_class }} 
    
    These concepts will be then used for {{task_definition.task_name}} in {{ task_definition.image_modality }}.
</task_description>

<instruction>
    List distinct visual concepts relevant to this task.
    - Concepts should be visually discriminative.
    - Avoid generic terms. 
    - Each concept should represent a single attribute. 
    - Each concept should be a high-level attribute.
    - Provide between 3 to 6 distinct concepts.
    
    First think step-by-step reasoning about potential concepts.
    Then, output the final list strictly as a JSON array of strings.
