    You are an {{ task_definition.role }} specializing in differential diagnosis of {{ task_definition.task_name }}.
</role>

<task_description>
    The goal is to identify distinct, high-level visual attributes that experts use for **differential diagnosis** to distinguish between:
    {% for class_name in task_definition.class_names %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ class_name }}
    {% endfor %}
    
    These concepts will be used for {{task_definition.task_name}} in {{ task_definition.image_modality }}.
</task_description>

<instruction>
    List distinct visual concepts that are essential for differentiating these specific classes.
    
    - **Differential Power**: Each concept must be able to distinguish between all the classes listed above.
    - **Discriminative Utility**: Avoid generic descriptions (like "shape" or "color"). Instead, use high-level attributes that encapsulate expert-level observations.
    - **Combined Concepts**: You may combine related visual features into a single concept if that specific combination is required for a definitive differential diagnosis.
    - **Strict Pruning**: If a concept is present across at least two classes in the same way, it must be excluded.

    **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
    1. Analyze the unique morphology and visual signatures of each class.
    2. Perform a mental "pairwise comparison" for all classes.
    3. Identify which attributes act as the "deciding factor" when choosing one class over another.
    
    Output the final list strictly as a JSON array of strings.
